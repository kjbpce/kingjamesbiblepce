[<b>1</b>] The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.<br>[<b>2</b>] Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.<br>[<b>3</b>] For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.<br>[<b>4</b>] I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.<br>[<b>5</b>] Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;<br>[<b>6</b>] Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:<br>[<b>7</b>] Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.<br>[<b>8</b>] We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.<br>[<b>9</b>] I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.<br>[<b>10</b>] Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.<br>[<b>11</b>] Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.<br>[<b>12</b>] Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.<br>[<b>13</b>] I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:<br>[<b>14</b>] But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.<br>
