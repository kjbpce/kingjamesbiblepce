[<b>1</b>] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.<br>[<b>2</b>] But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.<br>[<b>3</b>] And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.<br>[<b>4</b>] The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.<br>[<b>5</b>] Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br>[<b>6</b>] For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

[<b>1</b>] Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?<br>[<b>2</b>] The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,<br>[<b>3</b>] Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.<br>[<b>4</b>] He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.<br>[<b>5</b>] Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.<br>[<b>6</b>] Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.<br>[<b>7</b>] I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.<br>[<b>8</b>] Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br>[<b>9</b>] Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<br>[<b>10</b>] Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.<br>[<b>11</b>] Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.<br>[<b>12</b>] Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.

Selah.<br>[<b>3</b>] But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.<br>[<b>4</b>] Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.

<font size="2">To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,</font><BR>[<b>1</b>] I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.<br>[<b>2</b>] The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.<br>[<b>3</b>] I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.<br>[<b>4</b>] The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.<br>[<b>5</b>] The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.<br>[<b>6</b>] In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.<br>[<b>7</b>] Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.<br>[<b>8</b>] There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.<br>[<b>9</b>] He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.<br>[<b>10</b>] And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.<br>[<b>11</b>] He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.<br>[<b>12</b>] At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.<br>[<b>13</b>] The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.<br>[<b>14</b>] Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.<br>[<b>15</b>] Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.<br>[<b>16</b>] He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.<br>[<b>17</b>] He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.<br>[<b>18</b>] They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.<br>[<b>19</b>] He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.<br>[<b>20</b>] The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.<br>[<b>21</b>] For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br>[<b>22</b>] For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.<br>[<b>23</b>] I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.<br>[<b>24</b>] Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<br>[<b>25</b>] With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;<br>[<b>26</b>] With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.<br>[<b>27</b>] For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.<br>[<b>28</b>] For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.<br>[<b>29</b>] For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.<br>[<b>30</b>] As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.<br>[<b>31</b>] For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?<br>[<b>32</b>] It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.<br>[<b>33</b>] He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.<br>[<b>34</b>] He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.<br>[<b>35</b>] Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.<br>[<b>36</b>] Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.<br>[<b>37</b>] I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.<br>[<b>38</b>] I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.<br>[<b>39</b>] For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.<br>[<b>40</b>] Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.<br>[<b>41</b>] They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.<br>[<b>42</b>] Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.<br>[<b>43</b>] Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.<br>[<b>44</b>] As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.<br>[<b>45</b>] The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.<br>[<b>46</b>] The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.<br>[<b>47</b>] It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.<br>[<b>48</b>] He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.<br>[<b>49</b>] Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.<br>[<b>50</b>] Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

<font size="2">To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, A Psalm of David.</font><br>[<b>1</b>] Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.<br>[<b>2</b>] I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.<br>[<b>3</b>] I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.<br>[<b>4</b>] They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.<br>[<b>5</b>] O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.<br>[<b>6</b>] Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.<br>[<b>7</b>] Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.<br>[<b>8</b>] I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.<br>[<b>9</b>] For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.<br>[<b>10</b>] When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.<br>[<b>11</b>] I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.<br>[<b>12</b>] They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.<br>[<b>13</b>] But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.<br>[<b>14</b>] Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.<br>[<b>15</b>] Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.<br>[<b>16</b>] Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.<br>[<b>17</b>] And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.<br>[<b>18</b>] Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.<br>[<b>19</b>] Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.<br>[<b>20</b>] Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.<br>[<b>21</b>] They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<br>[<b>22</b>] Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.<br>[<b>23</b>] Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.<br>[<b>24</b>] Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.<br>[<b>25</b>] Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.<br>[<b>26</b>] For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.<br>[<b>27</b>] Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.<br>[<b>28</b>] Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.<br>[<b>29</b>] But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.<br>[<b>30</b>] I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br>[<b>31</b>] This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.<br>[<b>32</b>] The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.<br>[<b>33</b>] For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.<br>[<b>34</b>] Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moveth therein.<br>[<b>35</b>] For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.<br>[<b>36</b>] The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.

But while their meat was yet in their mouths,<br>[<b>31</b>] The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.<br>[<b>32</b>] For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.<br>[<b>33</b>] Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.<br>[<b>34</b>] When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.<br>[<b>35</b>] And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.<br>[<b>36</b>] Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.<br>[<b>37</b>] For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.<br>[<b>38</b>] But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.<br>[<b>39</b>] For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<br>[<b>40</b>] How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!<br>[<b>41</b>] Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.<br>[<b>42</b>] They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.<br>[<b>43</b>] How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:<br>[<b>44</b>] And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.<br>[<b>45</b>] He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<br>[<b>46</b>] He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.<br>[<b>47</b>] He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.<br>[<b>48</b>] He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br>[<b>49</b>] He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.<br>[<b>50</b>] He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<br>[<b>51</b>] And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:<br>[<b>52</b>] But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br>[<b>53</b>] And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br>[<b>54</b>] And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.<br>[<b>55</b>] He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br>[<b>56</b>] Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:<br>[<b>57</b>] But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br>[<b>58</b>] For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.<br>[<b>59</b>] When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:<br>[<b>60</b>] So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;<br>[<b>61</b>] And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.<br>[<b>62</b>] He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.<br>[<b>63</b>] The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.<br>[<b>64</b>] Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.<br>[<b>65</b>] Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.<br>[<b>66</b>] And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.<br>[<b>67</b>] Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br>[<b>68</b>] But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.<br>[<b>69</b>] And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.<br>[<b>70</b>] He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:<br>[<b>71</b>] From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.<br>[<b>72</b>] So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

Selah.<br>[<b>46</b>] How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?<br>[<b>47</b>] Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?<br>[<b>48</b>] What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.<br>[<b>49</b>] Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?<br>[<b>50</b>] Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;<br>[<b>51</b>] Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.<br>[<b>52</b>] Blessed be the LORD for evermore.

<font size="2">A Psalm of David.</font><br>[<b>1</b>] LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.<br>[<b>2</b>] Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.<br>[<b>3</b>] Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.<br>[<b>4</b>] Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.<br>[<b>5</b>] Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.<br>[<b>6</b>] When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.<br>[<b>7</b>] Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.<br>[<b>8</b>] But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.<br>[<b>9</b>] Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.<br>[<b>10</b>] Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.

<font size="2">Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.</font><br>[<b>1</b>] I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.<br>[<b>2</b>] I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.<br>[<b>3</b>] When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.<br>[<b>4</b>] I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.<br>[<b>5</b>] I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.<br>[<b>6</b>] Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.<br>[<b>7</b>] Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
