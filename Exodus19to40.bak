[<b>1</b>] In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.<br>[<b>2</b>] For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.<br>[<b>3</b>] And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;<br>[<b>4</b>] Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.<br>[<b>5</b>] Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:<br>[<b>6</b>] And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.<br>[<b>7</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.<br>[<b>8</b>] And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.<br>[<b>9</b>] And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.<br>[<b>10</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,<br>[<b>11</b>] And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.<br>[<b>12</b>] And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:<br>[<b>13</b>] There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.<br>[<b>14</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.<br>[<b>15</b>] And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.<br>[<b>16</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.<br>[<b>17</b>] And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.<br>[<b>18</b>] And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.<br>[<b>19</b>] And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.<br>[<b>20</b>] And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.<br>[<b>21</b>] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.<br>[<b>22</b>] And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.<br>[<b>23</b>] And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.<br>[<b>24</b>] And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.<br>[<b>25</b>] So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

[<b>1</b>] Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.<br>[<b>2</b>] If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.<br>[<b>3</b>] If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.<br>[<b>4</b>] If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.<br>[<b>5</b>] And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:<br>[<b>6</b>] Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.<br>[<b>7</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.<br>[<b>8</b>] If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.<br>[<b>9</b>] And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.<br>[<b>10</b>] If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.<br>[<b>11</b>] And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.<br>[<b>12</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.<br>[<b>13</b>] And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.<br>[<b>14</b>] But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.<br>[<b>15</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.<br>[<b>16</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.<br>[<b>17</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.<br>[<b>18</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:<br>[<b>19</b>] If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.<br>[<b>20</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand;

he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.<br>[<b>33</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;<br>[<b>34</b>] The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.<br>[<b>35</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it;
