[<b>1</b>] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.<br>[<b>2</b>] And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.<br>[<b>3</b>] His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.<br>[<b>4</b>] And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.<br>[<b>5</b>] And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.<br>[<b>6</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.<br>[<b>7</b>] And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<br>[<b>8</b>] And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?<br>[<b>9</b>] Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?<br>[<b>10</b>] Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.<br>[<b>11</b>] But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.<br>[<b>12</b>] And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.<br>[<b>13</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:<br>[<b>14</b>] And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:<br>[<b>15</b>] And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br>[<b>16</b>] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br>[<b>17</b>] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br>[<b>18</b>] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:<br>[<b>19</b>] And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br>[<b>20</b>] Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,<br>[<b>21</b>] And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.<br>[<b>22</b>] In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

[<b>1</b>] Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.<br>[<b>2</b>] And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<br>[<b>3</b>] And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.<br>[<b>4</b>] And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.<br>[<b>5</b>] But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.<br>[<b>6</b>] And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.<br>[<b>7</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.<br>[<b>8</b>] And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.<br>[<b>9</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.<br>[<b>10</b>] But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.<br>[<b>11</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.<br>[<b>12</b>] And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.<br>[<b>13</b>] So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.

[<b>1</b>] After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.<br>[<b>2</b>] And Job spake, and said,<br>[<b>3</b>] Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.<br>[<b>4</b>] Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.<br>[<b>5</b>] Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.<br>[<b>6</b>] As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.<br>[<b>7</b>] Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.<br>[<b>8</b>] Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.<br>[<b>9</b>] Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:<br>[<b>10</b>] Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.<br>[<b>11</b>] Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?<br>[<b>12</b>] Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?<br>[<b>13</b>] For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,<br>[<b>14</b>] With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;<br>[<b>15</b>] Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:<br>[<b>16</b>] Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.<br>[<b>17</b>] There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.<br>[<b>18</b>] There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.<br>[<b>19</b>] The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.<br>[<b>20</b>] Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;<br>[<b>21</b>] Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;<br>[<b>22</b>] Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?<br>[<b>23</b>] Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?<br>[<b>24</b>] For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.<br>[<b>25</b>] For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.<br>[<b>26</b>] I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.

[<b>1</b>] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br>[<b>2</b>] If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?<br>[<b>3</b>] Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.<br>[<b>4</b>] Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.<br>[<b>5</b>] But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.<br>[<b>6</b>] Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?<br>[<b>7</b>] Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?<br>[<b>8</b>] Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.<br>[<b>9</b>] By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.<br>[<b>10</b>] The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.<br>[<b>11</b>] The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.<br>[<b>12</b>] Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.<br>[<b>13</b>] In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,<br>[<b>14</b>] Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.<br>[<b>15</b>] Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:<br>[<b>16</b>] It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,<br>[<b>17</b>] Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?<br>[<b>18</b>] Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:<br>[<b>19</b>] How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?<br>[<b>20</b>] They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.<br>[<b>21</b>] Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.

[<b>1</b>] Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?<br>[<b>2</b>] For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.<br>[<b>3</b>] I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.<br>[<b>4</b>] His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.<br>[<b>5</b>] Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.<br>[<b>6</b>] Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;<br>[<b>7</b>] Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.<br>[<b>8</b>] I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:<br>[<b>9</b>] Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:<br>[<b>10</b>] Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:<br>[<b>11</b>] To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.<br>[<b>12</b>] He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.<br>[<b>13</b>] He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.<br>[<b>14</b>] They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.<br>[<b>15</b>] But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.<br>[<b>16</b>] So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.<br>[<b>17</b>] Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:<br>[<b>18</b>] For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.<br>[<b>19</b>] He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.<br>[<b>20</b>] In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.<br>[<b>21</b>] Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.<br>[<b>22</b>] At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.<br>[<b>23</b>] For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.<br>[<b>24</b>] And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.<br>[<b>25</b>] Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.<br>[<b>26</b>] Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.<br>[<b>27</b>] Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.

[<b>1</b>] But Job answered and said,<br>[<b>2</b>] Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!<br>[<b>3</b>] For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.<br>[<b>4</b>] For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.<br>[<b>5</b>] Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?<br>[<b>6</b>] Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?<br>[<b>7</b>] The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.<br>[<b>8</b>] Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!<br>[<b>9</b>] Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!<br>[<b>10</b>] Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.<br>[<b>11</b>] What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?<br>[<b>12</b>] Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?<br>[<b>13</b>] Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?<br>[<b>14</b>] To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.<br>[<b>15</b>] My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;<br>[<b>16</b>] Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:<br>[<b>17</b>] What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.<br>[<b>18</b>] The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.<br>[<b>19</b>] The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.<br>[<b>20</b>] They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.<br>[<b>21</b>] For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.<br>[<b>22</b>] Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?<br>[<b>23</b>] Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?<br>[<b>24</b>] Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.<br>[<b>25</b>] How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?<br>[<b>26</b>] Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?<br>[<b>27</b>] Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.<br>[<b>28</b>] Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.<br>[<b>29</b>] Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.<br>[<b>30</b>] Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?

[<b>1</b>] My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.<br>[<b>2</b>] I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.<br>[<b>3</b>] Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?<br>[<b>4</b>] Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?<br>[<b>5</b>] Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,<br>[<b>6</b>] That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?<br>[<b>7</b>] Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.<br>[<b>8</b>] Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.<br>[<b>9</b>] Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?<br>[<b>10</b>] Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?<br>[<b>11</b>] Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.<br>[<b>12</b>] Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.<br>[<b>13</b>] And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.<br>[<b>14</b>] If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.<br>[<b>15</b>] If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;<br>[<b>16</b>] For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.<br>[<b>17</b>] Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.<br>[<b>18</b>] Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!<br>[<b>19</b>] I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.<br>[<b>20</b>] Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,<br>[<b>21</b>] Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;<br>[<b>22</b>] A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.

[<b>1</b>] But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.<br>[<b>2</b>] Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?<br>[<b>3</b>] For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.<br>[<b>4</b>] Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.<br>[<b>5</b>] They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)<br>[<b>6</b>] To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.<br>[<b>7</b>] Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.<br>[<b>8</b>] They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.<br>[<b>9</b>] And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.<br>[<b>10</b>] They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.<br>[<b>11</b>] Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.<br>[<b>12</b>] Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.<br>[<b>13</b>] They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.<br>[<b>14</b>] They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.<br>[<b>15</b>] Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.<br>[<b>16</b>] And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.<br>[<b>17</b>] My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.<br>[<b>18</b>] By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.<br>[<b>19</b>] He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.<br>[<b>20</b>] I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.<br>[<b>21</b>] Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.<br>[<b>22</b>] Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.<br>[<b>23</b>] For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.<br>[<b>24</b>] Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.<br>[<b>25</b>] Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?<br>[<b>26</b>] When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.<br>[<b>27</b>] My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.<br>[<b>28</b>] I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.<br>[<b>29</b>] I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.<br>[<b>30</b>] My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.<br>[<b>31</b>] My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.

[<b>1</b>] So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.<br>[<b>2</b>] Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.<br>[<b>3</b>] Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.<br>[<b>4</b>] Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.<br>[<b>5</b>] When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.<br>[<b>6</b>] And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.<br>[<b>7</b>] I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.<br>[<b>8</b>] But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.<br>[<b>9</b>] Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.<br>[<b>10</b>] Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.<br>[<b>11</b>] Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.<br>[<b>12</b>] Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:<br>[<b>13</b>] Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.<br>[<b>14</b>] Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.<br>[<b>15</b>] They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.<br>[<b>16</b>] When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)<br>[<b>17</b>] I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.<br>[<b>18</b>] For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.<br>[<b>19</b>] Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.<br>[<b>20</b>] I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.<br>[<b>21</b>] Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.<br>[<b>22</b>] For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.

[<b>1</b>] Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,<br>[<b>2</b>] Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?<br>[<b>3</b>] Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.<br>[<b>4</b>] Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.<br>[<b>5</b>] Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?<br>[<b>6</b>] Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;<br>[<b>7</b>] When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?<br>[<b>8</b>] Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?<br>[<b>9</b>] When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,<br>[<b>10</b>] And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,<br>[<b>11</b>] And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?<br>[<b>12</b>] Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;<br>[<b>13</b>] That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?<br>[<b>14</b>] It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.<br>[<b>15</b>] And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.<br>[<b>16</b>] Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?<br>[<b>17</b>] Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?<br>[<b>18</b>] Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.<br>[<b>19</b>] Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,<br>[<b>20</b>] That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?<br>[<b>21</b>] Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?<br>[<b>22</b>] Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,<br>[<b>23</b>] Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?<br>[<b>24</b>] By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?<br>[<b>25</b>] Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;<br>[<b>26</b>] To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;<br>[<b>27</b>] To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?<br>[<b>28</b>] Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?<br>[<b>29</b>] Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?<br>[<b>30</b>] The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.<br>[<b>31</b>] Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?<br>[<b>32</b>] Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?<br>[<b>33</b>] Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?<br>[<b>34</b>] Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?<br>[<b>35</b>] Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?<br>[<b>36</b>] Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?<br>[<b>37</b>] Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,<br>[<b>38</b>] When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?<br>[<b>39</b>] Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,<br>[<b>40</b>] When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?<br>[<b>41</b>] Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.

[<b>1</b>] Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?<br>[<b>2</b>] Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?<br>[<b>3</b>] They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.<br>[<b>4</b>] Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.<br>[<b>5</b>] Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?<br>[<b>6</b>] Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.<br>[<b>7</b>] He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.<br>[<b>8</b>] The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.<br>[<b>9</b>] Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?<br>[<b>10</b>] Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?<br>[<b>11</b>] Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?<br>[<b>12</b>] Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?<br>[<b>13</b>] Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?<br>[<b>14</b>] Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,<br>[<b>15</b>] And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.<br>[<b>16</b>] She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;<br>[<b>17</b>] Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.<br>[<b>18</b>] What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.<br>[<b>19</b>] Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?<br>[<b>20</b>] Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.<br>[<b>21</b>] He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.<br>[<b>22</b>] He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.<br>[<b>23</b>] The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.<br>[<b>24</b>] He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.<br>[<b>25</b>] He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.<br>[<b>26</b>] Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?<br>[<b>27</b>] Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?<br>[<b>28</b>] She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.<br>[<b>29</b>] From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.<br>[<b>30</b>] Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.

[<b>1</b>] Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,<br>[<b>2</b>] Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.<br>[<b>3</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<br>[<b>4</b>] Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?

[<b>1</b>] Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?<br>[<b>2</b>] Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?<br>[<b>3</b>] Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?<br>[<b>4</b>] Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?<br>[<b>5</b>] Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?<br>[<b>6</b>] Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?<br>[<b>7</b>] Canst thou fill his skin with barbed iron? or his head with fish spears?<br>[<b>8</b>] Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.<br>[<b>9</b>] Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?<br>[<b>10</b>] None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?<br>[<b>11</b>] Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.<br>[<b>12</b>] I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.<br>[<b>13</b>] Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?<br>[<b>14</b>] Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.<br>[<b>15</b>] His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.<br>[<b>16</b>] One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.<br>[<b>17</b>] They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.<br>[<b>18</b>] By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.<br>[<b>19</b>] Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.<br>[<b>20</b>] Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.<br>[<b>21</b>] His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.<br>[<b>22</b>] In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.<br>[<b>23</b>] The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.<br>[<b>24</b>] His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.<br>[<b>25</b>] When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.<br>[<b>26</b>] The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.<br>[<b>27</b>] He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.<br>[<b>28</b>] The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.<br>[<b>29</b>] Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.<br>[<b>30</b>] Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.<br>[<b>31</b>] He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.<br>[<b>32</b>] He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.<br>[<b>33</b>] Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.<br>[<b>34</b>] He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.

[<b>1</b>] Then Job answered the LORD, and said,<br>[<b>2</b>] I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.<br>[<b>3</b>] Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.<br>[<b>4</b>] Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<br>[<b>5</b>] I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.<br>[<b>6</b>] Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.<br>[<b>7</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.<br>[<b>8</b>] Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.<br>[<b>9</b>] So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.<br>[<b>10</b>] And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.<br>[<b>11</b>] Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.<br>[<b>12</b>] So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.<br>[<b>13</b>] He had also seven sons and three daughters.<br>[<b>14</b>] And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.<br>[<b>15</b>] And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.<br>[<b>16</b>] After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.<br>[<b>17</b>] So Job died, being old and full of days.<br>
