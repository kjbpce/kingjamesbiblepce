also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br>[<b>10</b>] And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.<br>[<b>11</b>] And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.<br>[<b>12</b>] And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.<br>[<b>13</b>] And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br>[<b>14</b>] And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.<br>[<b>15</b>] And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.<br>[<b>16</b>] And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.<br>[<b>17</b>] But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp;

[<b>1</b>] And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;<br>[<b>2</b>] And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.<br>[<b>3</b>] And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;<br>[<b>4</b>] Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.<br>[<b>5</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.<br>[<b>6</b>] And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.<br>[<b>7</b>] And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.<br>[<b>8</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.<br>[<b>9</b>] And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:<br>[<b>10</b>] But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br>[<b>11</b>] And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.<br>[<b>12</b>] And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.<br>[<b>13</b>] And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.<br>[<b>14</b>] And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.<br>[<b>15</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.<br>[<b>16</b>] And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.<br>[<b>17</b>] And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.<br>[<b>18</b>] He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,<br>[<b>19</b>] And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:<br>[<b>20</b>] And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:<br>[<b>21</b>] And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.<br>[<b>22</b>] And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.<br>[<b>23</b>] And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.<br>[<b>24</b>] And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

[<b>1</b>] And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.<br>[<b>2</b>] And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.<br>[<b>3</b>] Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.<br>[<b>4</b>] And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.<br>[<b>5</b>] So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.<br>[<b>6</b>] And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.<br>[<b>7</b>] And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.<br>[<b>8</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,<br>[<b>9</b>] Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:<br>[<b>10</b>] And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;<br>[<b>11</b>] And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.<br>[<b>12</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:<br>[<b>13</b>] And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.<br>[<b>14</b>] And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.<br>[<b>15</b>] The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.<br>[<b>16</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,<br>[<b>17</b>] Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?<br>[<b>18</b>] Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.<br>[<b>19</b>] And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?<br>[<b>20</b>] And when Moses heard that, he was content.

he is unclean unto you.<br>[<b>7</b>] And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.<br>[<b>8</b>] Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.<br>[<b>9</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.<br>[<b>10</b>] And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:<br>[<b>11</b>] They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.<br>[<b>12</b>] Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.<br>[<b>13</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls;

he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.<br>[<b>40</b>] And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.<br>[<b>41</b>] And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.<br>[<b>42</b>] Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.<br>[<b>43</b>] Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.<br>[<b>44</b>] For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br>[<b>45</b>] For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.<br>[<b>46</b>] This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:<br>[<b>47</b>] To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.

then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:<br>[<b>3</b>] And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.<br>[<b>4</b>] If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:<br>[<b>5</b>] And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:<br>[<b>6</b>] And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.<br>[<b>7</b>] But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:<br>[<b>8</b>] And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.<br>[<b>9</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;<br>[<b>10</b>] And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;<br>[<b>11</b>] It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.<br>[<b>12</b>] And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;<br>[<b>13</b>] Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.<br>[<b>14</b>] But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.<br>[<b>15</b>] And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.<br>[<b>16</b>] Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;<br>[<b>17</b>] And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.<br>[<b>18</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,<br>[<b>19</b>] And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;<br>[<b>20</b>] And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.<br>[<b>21</b>] But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:<br>[<b>22</b>] And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.<br>[<b>23</b>] But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil;

it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.<br>[<b>26</b>] But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:<br>[<b>27</b>] And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.<br>[<b>28</b>] And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.<br>[<b>29</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;<br>[<b>30</b>] Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin;

then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:<br>[<b>32</b>] And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;<br>[<b>33</b>] He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:<br>[<b>34</b>] And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.<br>[<b>35</b>] But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;<br>[<b>36</b>] Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair;

it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.<br>[<b>40</b>] And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.<br>[<b>41</b>] And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.<br>[<b>42</b>] And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.<br>[<b>43</b>] Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;<br>[<b>44</b>] He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.<br>[<b>45</b>] And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.<br>[<b>46</b>] All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.<br>[<b>47</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;<br>[<b>48</b>] Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;<br>[<b>49</b>] And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:<br>[<b>50</b>] And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days:<br>[<b>51</b>] And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.<br>[<b>52</b>] He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.<br>[<b>53</b>] And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;<br>[<b>54</b>] Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:<br>[<b>55</b>] And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.<br>[<b>56</b>] And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:<br>[<b>57</b>] And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.<br>[<b>58</b>] And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.<br>[<b>59</b>] This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.<br>[<b>43</b>] And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;<br>[<b>44</b>] Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.<br>[<b>45</b>] And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.<br>[<b>46</b>] Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.<br>[<b>47</b>] And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.<br>[<b>48</b>] And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.<br>[<b>49</b>] And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:<br>[<b>50</b>] And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:<br>[<b>51</b>] And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:<br>[<b>52</b>] And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:<br>[<b>53</b>] But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.<br>[<b>54</b>] This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,<br>[<b>55</b>] And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,<br>[<b>56</b>] And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:<br>[<b>57</b>] To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.

[<b>1</b>] And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;<br>[<b>2</b>] And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.<br>[<b>3</b>] Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.<br>[<b>4</b>] He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.<br>[<b>5</b>] And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.<br>[<b>6</b>] And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.<br>[<b>7</b>] And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<br>[<b>8</b>] And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats;

one of his brethren may redeem him:<br>[<b>49</b>] Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.<br>[<b>50</b>] And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.<br>[<b>51</b>] If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.<br>[<b>52</b>] And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.<br>[<b>53</b>] And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.<br>[<b>54</b>] And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.<br>[<b>55</b>] For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

[<b>1</b>] Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.<br>[<b>2</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.<br>[<b>3</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;<br>[<b>4</b>] Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.<br>[<b>5</b>] And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.<br>[<b>6</b>] And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.<br>[<b>7</b>] And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.<br>[<b>8</b>] And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.<br>[<b>9</b>] For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.<br>[<b>10</b>] And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.<br>[<b>11</b>] And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.<br>[<b>12</b>] And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.<br>[<b>13</b>] I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.<br>[<b>14</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;<br>[<b>15</b>] And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:<br>[<b>16</b>] I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.<br>[<b>17</b>] And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.<br>[<b>18</b>] And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.<br>[<b>19</b>] And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:<br>[<b>20</b>] And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.<br>[<b>21</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.<br>[<b>22</b>] I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your highways shall be desolate.<br>[<b>23</b>] And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;<br>[<b>24</b>] Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.<br>[<b>25</b>] And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.<br>[<b>26</b>] And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.<br>[<b>27</b>] And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;<br>[<b>28</b>] Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.<br>[<b>29</b>] And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.<br>[<b>30</b>] And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.<br>[<b>31</b>] And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.<br>[<b>32</b>] And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.<br>[<b>33</b>] And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.<br>[<b>34</b>] Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.<br>[<b>35</b>] As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.<br>[<b>36</b>] And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.<br>[<b>37</b>] And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.<br>[<b>38</b>] And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.<br>[<b>39</b>] And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.<br>[<b>40</b>] If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;<br>[<b>41</b>] And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:<br>[<b>42</b>] Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.<br>[<b>43</b>] The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.<br>[<b>44</b>] And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.<br>[<b>45</b>] But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.<br>[<b>46</b>] These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

[<b>1</b>] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>[<b>2</b>] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.<br>[<b>3</b>] And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.<br>[<b>4</b>] And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.<br>[<b>5</b>] And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.<br>[<b>6</b>] And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.<br>[<b>7</b>] And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.<br>[<b>8</b>] But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.<br>[<b>9</b>] And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.<br>[<b>10</b>] He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.<br>[<b>11</b>] And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:<br>[<b>12</b>] And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.<br>[<b>13</b>] But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.<br>[<b>14</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.<br>[<b>15</b>] And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.<br>[<b>16</b>] And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.<br>[<b>17</b>] If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.<br>[<b>18</b>] But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.<br>[<b>19</b>] And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.<br>[<b>20</b>] And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.<br>[<b>21</b>] But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.<br>[<b>22</b>] And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;<br>[<b>23</b>] Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.<br>[<b>24</b>] In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.<br>[<b>25</b>] And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.<br>[<b>26</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's.<br>[<b>27</b>] And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.<br>[<b>28</b>] Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.<br>[<b>29</b>] None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.<br>[<b>30</b>] And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.<br>[<b>31</b>] And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.<br>[<b>32</b>] And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.<br>[<b>33</b>] He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.<br>[<b>34</b>] These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.<br></b>
