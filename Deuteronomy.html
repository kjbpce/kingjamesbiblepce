[<b>1</b>] These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.<br>[<b>2</b>] (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.)<br>[<b>3</b>] And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;<br>[<b>4</b>] After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:<br>[<b>5</b>] On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,<br>[<b>6</b>] The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:<br>[<b>7</b>] Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.<br>[<b>8</b>] Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.<br>[<b>9</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:<br>[<b>10</b>] The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.<br>[<b>11</b>] (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)<br>[<b>12</b>] How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?<br>[<b>13</b>] Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.<br>[<b>14</b>] And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.<br>[<b>15</b>] So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.<br>[<b>16</b>] And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.<br>[<b>17</b>] Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.<br>[<b>18</b>] And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.<br>[<b>19</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.<br>[<b>20</b>] And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.<br>[<b>21</b>] Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.<br>[<b>22</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.<br>[<b>23</b>] And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:<br>[<b>24</b>] And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.<br>[<b>25</b>] And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.<br>[<b>26</b>] Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:<br>[<b>27</b>] And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.<br>[<b>28</b>] Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.<br>[<b>29</b>] Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.<br>[<b>30</b>] The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;<br>[<b>31</b>] And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.<br>[<b>32</b>] Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,<br>[<b>33</b>] Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.<br>[<b>34</b>] And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,<br>[<b>35</b>] Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,<br>[<b>36</b>] Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.<br>[<b>37</b>] Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.<br>[<b>38</b>] But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.<br>[<b>39</b>] Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.<br>[<b>40</b>] But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.<br>[<b>41</b>] Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.<br>[<b>42</b>] And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.<br>[<b>43</b>] So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.<br>[<b>44</b>] And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.<br>[<b>45</b>] And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.<br>[<b>46</b>] So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.

[<b>1</b>] Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.<br>[<b>2</b>] And the LORD spake unto me, saying,<br>[<b>3</b>] Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.<br>[<b>4</b>] And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:<br>[<b>5</b>] Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.<br>[<b>6</b>] Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.<br>[<b>7</b>] For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.<br>[<b>8</b>] And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.<br>[<b>9</b>] And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.<br>[<b>10</b>] The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;<br>[<b>11</b>] Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.<br>[<b>12</b>] The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.<br>[<b>13</b>] Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.<br>[<b>14</b>] And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.<br>[<b>15</b>] For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.<br>[<b>16</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,<br>[<b>17</b>] That the LORD spake unto me, saying,<br>[<b>18</b>] Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:<br>[<b>19</b>] And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.<br>[<b>20</b>] (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;<br>[<b>21</b>] A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:<br>[<b>22</b>] As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:<br>[<b>23</b>] And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)<br>[<b>24</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.<br>[<b>25</b>] This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.<br>[<b>26</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,<br>[<b>27</b>] Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.<br>[<b>28</b>] Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;<br>[<b>29</b>] (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.<br>[<b>30</b>] But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.<br>[<b>31</b>] And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.<br>[<b>32</b>] Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.<br>[<b>33</b>] And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.<br>[<b>34</b>] And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:<br>[<b>35</b>] Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.<br>[<b>36</b>] From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:<br>[<b>37</b>] Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

[<b>1</b>] Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.<br>[<b>2</b>] And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.<br>[<b>3</b>] So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.<br>[<b>4</b>] And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.<br>[<b>5</b>] All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.<br>[<b>6</b>] And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.<br>[<b>7</b>] But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.<br>[<b>8</b>] And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;<br>[<b>9</b>] (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)<br>[<b>10</b>] All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.<br>[<b>11</b>] For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.<br>[<b>12</b>] And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.<br>[<b>13</b>] And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.<br>[<b>14</b>] Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day.<br>[<b>15</b>] And I gave Gilead unto Machir.<br>[<b>16</b>] And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;<br>[<b>17</b>] The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.<br>[<b>18</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.<br>[<b>19</b>] But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;<br>[<b>20</b>] Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.<br>[<b>21</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.<br>[<b>22</b>] Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.<br>[<b>23</b>] And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,<br>[<b>24</b>] O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?<br>[<b>25</b>] I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.<br>[<b>26</b>] But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.<br>[<b>27</b>] Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.<br>[<b>28</b>] But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.<br>[<b>29</b>] So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.

[<b>1</b>] Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.<br>[<b>2</b>] Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.<br>[<b>3</b>] Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.<br>[<b>4</b>] But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.<br>[<b>5</b>] Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.<br>[<b>6</b>] Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.<br>[<b>7</b>] For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?<br>[<b>8</b>] And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?<br>[<b>9</b>] Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;<br>[<b>10</b>] Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.<br>[<b>11</b>] And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.<br>[<b>12</b>] And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.<br>[<b>13</b>] And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.<br>[<b>14</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.<br>[<b>15</b>] Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:<br>[<b>16</b>] Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,<br>[<b>17</b>] The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,<br>[<b>18</b>] The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:<br>[<b>19</b>] And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.<br>[<b>20</b>] But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.<br>[<b>21</b>] Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:<br>[<b>22</b>] But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.<br>[<b>23</b>] Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.<br>[<b>24</b>] For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.<br>[<b>25</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:<br>[<b>26</b>] I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.<br>[<b>27</b>] And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.<br>[<b>28</b>] And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.<br>[<b>29</b>] But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.<br>[<b>30</b>] When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;<br>[<b>31</b>] (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.<br>[<b>32</b>] For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?<br>[<b>33</b>] Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?<br>[<b>34</b>] Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?<br>[<b>35</b>] Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.<br>[<b>36</b>] Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.<br>[<b>37</b>] And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;<br>[<b>38</b>] To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.<br>[<b>39</b>] Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.<br>[<b>40</b>] Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.<br>[<b>41</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;<br>[<b>42</b>] That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past;

[<b>1</b>] Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:<br>[<b>2</b>] That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.<br>[<b>3</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.<br>[<b>4</b>] Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:<br>[<b>5</b>] And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.<br>[<b>6</b>] And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:<br>[<b>7</b>] And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.<br>[<b>8</b>] And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.<br>[<b>9</b>] And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.<br>[<b>10</b>] And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,<br>[<b>11</b>] And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;<br>[<b>12</b>] Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.<br>[<b>13</b>] Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.<br>[<b>14</b>] Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;<br>[<b>15</b>] (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.<br>[<b>16</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.<br>[<b>17</b>] Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.<br>[<b>18</b>] And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,<br>[<b>19</b>] To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.<br>[<b>20</b>] And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?<br>[<b>21</b>] Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:<br>[<b>22</b>] And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:<br>[<b>23</b>] And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.<br>[<b>24</b>] And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.<br>[<b>25</b>] And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.

[<b>1</b>] Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,<br>[<b>2</b>] A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!<br>[<b>3</b>] Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.<br>[<b>4</b>] Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.<br>[<b>5</b>] Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br>[<b>6</b>] Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.<br>[<b>7</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.<br>[<b>8</b>] Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.<br>[<b>9</b>] When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:<br>[<b>10</b>] And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.<br>[<b>11</b>] And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.<br>[<b>12</b>] And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.<br>[<b>13</b>] Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:<br>[<b>14</b>] Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.<br>[<b>15</b>] So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.<br>[<b>16</b>] And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.<br>[<b>17</b>] And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.<br>[<b>18</b>] And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.<br>[<b>19</b>] For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.<br>[<b>20</b>] And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.<br>[<b>21</b>] And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.<br>[<b>22</b>] And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.<br>[<b>23</b>] Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.<br>[<b>24</b>] Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.<br>[<b>25</b>] Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.<br>[<b>26</b>] I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.<br>[<b>27</b>] Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:<br>[<b>28</b>] Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.<br>[<b>29</b>] Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.

and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.<br>[<b>4</b>] Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.<br>[<b>5</b>] But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:<br>[<b>6</b>] And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:<br>[<b>7</b>] And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.<br>[<b>8</b>] Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.<br>[<b>9</b>] For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.<br>[<b>10</b>] But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;<br>[<b>11</b>] Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there;

for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.<br>[<b>32</b>] What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:<br>[<b>34</b>] So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.<br>[<b>35</b>] The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.<br>[<b>36</b>] The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.<br>[<b>37</b>] And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.<br>[<b>38</b>] Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.<br>[<b>39</b>] Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.<br>[<b>40</b>] Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.<br>[<b>41</b>] Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.<br>[<b>42</b>] All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.<br>[<b>43</b>] The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.<br>[<b>44</b>] He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.<br>[<b>45</b>] Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:<br>[<b>46</b>] And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.<br>[<b>47</b>] Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;<br>[<b>48</b>] Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.<br>[<b>49</b>] The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;<br>[<b>50</b>] A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:<br>[<b>51</b>] And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.<br>[<b>52</b>] And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.<br>[<b>53</b>] And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:<br>[<b>54</b>] So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:<br>[<b>55</b>] So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.<br>[<b>56</b>] The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,<br>[<b>57</b>] And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.<br>[<b>58</b>] If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;<br>[<b>59</b>] Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.<br>[<b>60</b>] Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.<br>[<b>61</b>] Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.<br>[<b>62</b>] And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.<br>[<b>63</b>] And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.<br>[<b>64</b>] And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.<br>[<b>65</b>] And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:<br>[<b>66</b>] And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:<br>[<b>67</b>] In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.<br>[<b>68</b>] And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

[<b>1</b>] These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.<br>[<b>2</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;<br>[<b>3</b>] The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:<br>[<b>4</b>] Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.<br>[<b>5</b>] And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.<br>[<b>6</b>] Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.<br>[<b>7</b>] And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:<br>[<b>8</b>] And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.<br>[<b>9</b>] Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.<br>[<b>10</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,<br>[<b>11</b>] Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:<br>[<b>12</b>] That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:<br>[<b>13</b>] That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.<br>[<b>14</b>] Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;<br>[<b>15</b>] But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:<br>[<b>16</b>] (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;<br>[<b>17</b>] And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)<br>[<b>18</b>] Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;<br>[<b>19</b>] And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:<br>[<b>20</b>] The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.<br>[<b>21</b>] And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:<br>[<b>22</b>] So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;<br>[<b>23</b>] And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:<br>[<b>24</b>] Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?<br>[<b>25</b>] Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:<br>[<b>26</b>] For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:<br>[<b>27</b>] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:<br>[<b>28</b>] And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.<br>[<b>29</b>] The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

[<b>1</b>] And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.<br>[<b>2</b>] And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.<br>[<b>3</b>] The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.<br>[<b>4</b>] And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.<br>[<b>5</b>] And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.<br>[<b>6</b>] Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.<br>[<b>7</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.<br>[<b>8</b>] And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.<br>[<b>9</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.<br>[<b>10</b>] And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,<br>[<b>11</b>] When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.<br>[<b>12</b>] Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:<br>[<b>13</b>] And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.<br>[<b>14</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.<br>[<b>15</b>] And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.<br>[<b>16</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.<br>[<b>17</b>] Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day. Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?<br>[<b>18</b>] And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.<br>[<b>19</b>] Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.<br>[<b>20</b>] For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.<br>[<b>21</b>] And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.<br>[<b>22</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.<br>[<b>23</b>] And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.<br>[<b>24</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,<br>[<b>25</b>] That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,<br>[<b>26</b>] Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.<br>[<b>27</b>] For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?<br>[<b>28</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.<br>[<b>29</b>] For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.<br>[<b>30</b>] And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.

is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?<br>[<b>7</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.<br>[<b>8</b>] When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.<br>[<b>9</b>] For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.<br>[<b>10</b>] He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.<br>[<b>11</b>] As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:<br>[<b>12</b>] So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.<br>[<b>13</b>] He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;<br>[<b>14</b>] Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.<br>[<b>15</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.<br>[<b>16</b>] They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.<br>[<b>17</b>] They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.<br>[<b>18</b>] Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.<br>[<b>19</b>] And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.<br>[<b>20</b>] And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.<br>[<b>21</b>] They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.<br>[<b>22</b>] For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.<br>[<b>23</b>] I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.<br>[<b>24</b>] They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.<br>[<b>25</b>] The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.<br>[<b>26</b>] I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:<br>[<b>27</b>] Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.<br>[<b>28</b>] For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.<br>[<b>29</b>] O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!<br>[<b>30</b>] How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?<br>[<b>31</b>] For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.<br>[<b>32</b>] For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:<br>[<b>33</b>] Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.<br>[<b>34</b>] Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?<br>[<b>35</b>] To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.<br>[<b>36</b>] For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.<br>[<b>37</b>] And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,<br>[<b>38</b>] Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.<br>[<b>39</b>] See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.<br>[<b>40</b>] For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.<br>[<b>41</b>] If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.<br>[<b>42</b>] I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.<br>[<b>43</b>] Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.<br>[<b>44</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.<br>[<b>45</b>] And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:<br>[<b>46</b>] And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.<br>[<b>47</b>] For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.<br>[<b>48</b>] And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,<br>[<b>49</b>] Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:<br>[<b>50</b>] And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:<br>[<b>51</b>] Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.<br>[<b>52</b>] Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

[<b>1</b>] And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.<br>[<b>2</b>] And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them;

every one shall receive of thy words.<br>[<b>4</b>] Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.<br>[<b>5</b>] And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.<br>[<b>6</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> Let Reuben live, and not die;

neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.<br>[<b>10</b>] They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.<br>[<b>11</b>] Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.<br>[<b>12</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him;

and, Issachar, in thy tents.<br>[<b>19</b>] They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.<br>[<b>20</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.<br>[<b>21</b>] And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.<br>[<b>22</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.<br>[<b>23</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.<br>[<b>24</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children;

and shall say, Destroy them.<br>[<b>28</b>] Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.<br>[<b>29</b>] Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
