			[<b>1</b>] Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,<br>[<b>2</b>] And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:<br>[<b>3</b>] Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>[<b>4</b>] I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,<br>[<b>5</b>] Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;<br>[<b>6</b>] That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.<br>[<b>7</b>] For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.<br>[<b>8</b>] Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,<br>[<b>9</b>] Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.<br>[<b>10</b>] I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:<br>[<b>11</b>] Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:<br>[<b>12</b>] Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:<br>[<b>13</b>] Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:<br>[<b>14</b>] But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.<br>[<b>15</b>] For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;<br>[<b>16</b>] Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?<br>[<b>17</b>] If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.<br>[<b>18</b>] If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;<br>[<b>19</b>] I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.<br>[<b>20</b>] Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.<br>[<b>21</b>] Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.<br>[<b>22</b>] But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.<br>[<b>23</b>] There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;<br>[<b>24</b>] Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.<br>[<b>25</b>] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.<br>
