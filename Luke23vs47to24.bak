[<b>47</b>] Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.<br>[<b>48</b>] And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.<br>[<b>49</b>] And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.<br>[<b>50</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counseller; and he was a good man, and a just:<br>[<b>51</b>] (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.<br>[<b>52</b>] This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.<br>[<b>53</b>] And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.<br>[<b>54</b>] And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.<br>[<b>55</b>] And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.<br>[<b>56</b>] And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

<br><hr><h3>Luke 24</h3>

[<b>1</b>] Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.<br>[<b>2</b>] And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.<br>[<b>3</b>] And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.<br>[<b>4</b>] And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:<br>[<b>5</b>] And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?<br>[<b>6</b>] He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,<br>[<b>7</b>] Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<br>[<b>8</b>] And they remembered his words,<br>[<b>9</b>] And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.<br>[<b>10</b>] It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.<br>[<b>11</b>] And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.<br>[<b>12</b>] Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.<br>[<b>13</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.<br>[<b>14</b>] And they talked together of all these things which had happened.<br>[<b>15</b>] And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.<br>[<b>16</b>] But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.<br>[<b>17</b>] And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<br>[<b>18</b>] And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days?<br>[<b>19</b>] And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:<br>[<b>20</b>] And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.<br>[<b>21</b>] But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.<br>[<b>22</b>] Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;<br>[<b>23</b>] And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.<br>[<b>24</b>] And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.<br>[<b>25</b>] Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:<br>[<b>26</b>] Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?<br>[<b>27</b>] And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<br>[<b>28</b>] And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.<br>[<b>29</b>] But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.<br>[<b>30</b>] And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<br>[<b>31</b>] And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.<br>[<b>32</b>] And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<br>[<b>33</b>] And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,<br>[<b>34</b>] Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.<br>[<b>35</b>] And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.<br>[<b>36</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.<br>[<b>37</b>] But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.<br>[<b>38</b>] And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?<br>[<b>39</b>] Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.<br>[<b>40</b>] And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.<br>[<b>41</b>] And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?<br>[<b>42</b>] And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.<br>[<b>43</b>] And he took it, and did eat before them.<br>[<b>44</b>] And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.<br>[<b>45</b>] Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,<br>[<b>46</b>] And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:<br>[<b>47</b>] And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<br>[<b>48</b>] And ye are witnesses of these things.<br>[<b>49</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.<br>[<b>50</b>] <img alt="picrow (1K)" src="images/picrow.jpg" height="11" width="8" /> And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.<br>[<b>51</b>] And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.<br>[<b>52</b>] And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:<br>[<b>53</b>] And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.<br>
